title: A First Blog

This will be my personal blog to discuss my reflections on the Udacity
Front-end Web Developer Nano-degree.

It is mainly to help me to clarify the points I am learning so expect a few
mad ramblings.

I am now learning how to optimise websites having previously covered HTML,
CSS and JavaScript to build a website mockup and an online resum√© followed by
OOJ to build a web based frogger clone game.

My first few blog entries may come in a quick flurry as I attempt to update
entries for the stuff alreaady leaned.

Bye for now.
